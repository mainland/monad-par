-- instead it simply provides the singular point that a thread is allowed to return 
-- from.  The only concern is some potential for bad blocking - is that a legit

-- [Notes on threadCapability]
--
-- We create a thread on each CPU with forkOnIO.  Ideally, the CPU on 
-- which the current thread is running will host the main thread; the 
-- other CPUs will host worker threads.
--
-- This is possible using threadCapability, but this requires
-- GHC 7.1.20110301, because that is when threadCapability was added.
--
-- Lacking threadCapability, we always pick CPU #0 to run the main
-- thread.  If the current thread is not running on CPU #0, this
-- will require some data to be shipped over the memory bus, and
-- hence will be slightly slower than the version using threadCapability.
--
-- If this is a nested runPar call, then we can do slightly better.  We 
-- can look at the current workers' ThreadIds and see if we are one of 
-- them.  If so, we do the work on that core.  If not, we are once again 
-- forced to choose arbitrarily, so we send the work to CPU #0.
